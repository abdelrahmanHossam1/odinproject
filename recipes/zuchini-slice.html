        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>onions</li>
            <li>bacon slices</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>vegetables</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>self-raising flour</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
            <li>stack powder</li>
            <li>tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to make it</h2>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>The onions are added to the olive oil first and softened slightly before adding the carrots and garlic.</li>
            <li>Once the onions and carrots are soft and golden (a little colour at this point = flavour!), the bacon is added, followed by the zucchini.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetable and bacon mix is cooked and liquid has mostly evaporated, it is ready and set aside in the pan to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>The flour is added to the slightly cooled vegetables and stirred through.</li>
            <li>Then half the egg mixture is added and stirred, then add the remaining eggs and cheese and carefully combine.</li>
            <li>The eggs are added in 2 parts as it stops the mixture from forming clumps. Once the mixture is smooth, it is carefully poured into the lined pan.</li>
            <li>The slice is then sprinkled with parmesan cheese and topped with thinly sliced tomatoes before being placed in a preheated oven to cook for 25-30 minutes or until firm to the touch.</li>
